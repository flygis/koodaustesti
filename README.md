# What is done in this sample
Created a small demo that can be run using webpack-dev-server if npm and nodejs are installed on the machine.
Refactored the code and also included the original code in OriginalTableComponent file.
The demo displays my idea of what the code was supposed to be doing:
It renders a table with a header displaying how many seconds it has been running, and the body displays a button that shows or hides a span. Extracontent span displays some fetched data. I implemented a call to open weather API to get some data, and from that selected an attrivute to be displayed as the exta content.
